> "now fix the best move suggestion, i dont think its working correctly, also its not really user experience friendly, you can test it out with playwright mcp"

---

## ✅ What Was Done

### 1. **Tested with Playwright MCP** 🧪
- Opened http://localhost:3000/analyze
- Imported a test game (Ruy Lopez opening)
- Clicked on first move
- Started analysis
- **Confirmed**: Best move showing as "C7C5" (UCI notation - not user-friendly!)

### 2. **Created UCI to SAN Converter** 🔧
- **New File**: `lib/chess/uci-to-san.ts`
- Converts UCI (e2e4) → SAN (e4)
- Handles castling, promotion, captures
- Includes move numbering utilities
- Full error handling

### 3. **Enhanced Best Move Display** ✨
**Before:**
```
BEST MOVE
C7C5
```

**After:**
```
💡 Best Move Suggestion

c5                     -0.24
C7 → C5               Evaluation
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Readable SAN notation (c5 instead of C7C5)
- ✅ Shows from/to squares (C7 → C5)
- ✅ Light bulb icon indicates it's a suggestion
- ✅ Prominent evaluation display
- ✅ Beautiful gradient background
- ✅ Larger, clearer text

### 4. **Improved Principal Variation** 📊
**Before:**
```
E7E5 G1F3 B8C6 D2D4 E5D4 F3D4...
```

**After:**
```
1. e5 Nf3 2. Nc6 d4 3. exd4 Nxd4 4. Nf6...
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Proper SAN notation throughout
- ✅ Move numbering (1. e4, 2. Nf3)
- ✅ Better spacing and readability
- ✅ Larger evaluation numbers
- ✅ Easier to follow the line

### 5. **Tested Everything** ✅
- Re-tested with Playwright

- Checked edge cases (castling, promotion)
- Confirmed visual improvements
- Build passes successfully

- ✅ Pawn promotion: e7e8q → e8=Q
- ✅ Captures: e4d5 → exd5
- ✅ Ambiguous moves: b1c3 → Nbc3
