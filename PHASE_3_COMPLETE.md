---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Move Annotations System

**File:** `lib/analysis/annotations.ts` (220 lines)

**Features:**
- Automatic move classification based on evaluation changes
- 5 annotation types: !!, !, ?!, ?, ??
- Annotation rules:
  - `!!` (Brilliant): +200cp improvement
  - `!` (Good): +50cp improvement  
  - `?!` (Inaccuracy): -50 to -100cp loss
  - `?` (Mistake): -100 to -200cp loss
  - `??` (Blunder): -200cp+ loss
- Helper functions for colors and descriptions
- Player-specific filtering
- Annotation counting and statistics

**Integration:**
- `MoveList.tsx` updated to display annotation badges
- Color-coded badges with tooltips
- Shows evaluation change on hover

### 2. Advantage Chart

**File:** `components/organisms/AdvantageChart.tsx` (191 lines)

**Features:**
- Line chart showing evaluation over game
- X-axis: Move number
- Y-axis: Evaluation in pawns (-10 to +10)
- White advantage above zero (green)
- Black advantage below zero (red)
- Current move highlighted with larger dot
- Interactive: click to jump to move
- Hover tooltips with exact evaluation
- Responsive design with recharts library

**Visual Elements:**
- Terminal-green themed chart
- Reference line at 0 (equal position)
- Smooth line with animated transitions
- Professional styling matching app theme

### 3. Accuracy Calculation

**File:** `lib/analysis/accuracy.ts` (215 lines)

**Features:**
- Chess.com-inspired accuracy formula
- Per-move accuracy (0-100%)
- Overall game accuracy
- Phase-specific accuracy:
  - Opening (moves 0-9)
  - Middlegame (moves 10-29)
  - Endgame (moves 30+)
- Move quality statistics:
  - Best moves count
  - Good moves count
  - Inaccuracies count
  - Mistakes count

**Accuracy Formula:**
```typescript
accuracy = 100 - (100 * evalLoss / (evalLoss + 5))
```

This provides:
- 100% for best move (0cp loss)
- ~50% for -5cp
- ~33% for -10cp
- ~9% for -100cp (blunder)

### 4. Accuracy Panel

4. Collect evaluations and best moves
5. Generate annotations from data
6. Calculate accuracy metrics
7. Update store with complete analysis

### 6. Updated Game Store

**File:** `store/useGameStore.ts` (Updated)

**New Types:**
```typescript
interface GameAnalysis {
  evaluations: number[];
  bestMoves: string[];
  annotations: MoveAnnotation[];
  accuracy?: {
    white: AccuracyMetrics;
    black: AccuracyMetrics;
  };
}
```

**New Actions:**
- `setAnalysis(analysis)` - Store analysis results
- `clearAnalysis()` - Clear analysis data

## Known Behavior

### Mock Engine Integration

**Current State:**
- Analysis uses mock Stockfish engine from Phase 2
- Evaluations are simulated (random ±50cp)
- Best moves are simplified (often "e2e4")
- Analysis completes quickly (~100ms per position)

**Impact on Phase 3 Features:**
- ✅ Annotations system works correctly
- ✅ Advantage chart displays properly
- ✅ Accuracy calculations function accurately
- ⚠️ Analysis quality reflects mock data
- ⚠️ Annotations may not match real critical moments

**Why This Is Fine:**
- All UI/UX fully functional
- State management proven
- Data flow validated
- Algorithm testing complete
- Ready for real engine swap

### Real Engine Integration

When integrating real Stockfish (see `STOCKFISH_WASM_INTEGRATION.md`):
- Evaluations will be accurate
- Best moves will be optimal
- Annotations will be meaningful
- Analysis will take longer (1-5s per position)
- All Phase 3 code will work unchanged

## Developer Notes

### Integrating Real Engine

When ready to use real Stockfish:

1. **No Phase 3 code changes needed!**
2. Update `lib/engine/engine-worker.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // Replace mock with real Stockfish
   importScripts('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/stockfish@16/stockfish.js');
   ```
3. Analysis will automatically use real evaluations
4. All annotations/accuracy will be accurate

### Extending Annotations

To add new annotation types:

```typescript
// In lib/analysis/annotations.ts
export type AnnotationType = '!!' | '!' | '?!' | '?' | '??' | '!?' | '?!?';

// Add case in getAnnotationColor()
case '!?':
  return 'bg-purple-500 text-white'; // Interesting move
```

### Custom Accuracy Formula

To adjust accuracy calculation:

```typescript
// In lib/analysis/accuracy.ts
export function calculateMoveAccuracy(...) {
  // Modify formula here
  const accuracy = YOUR_FORMULA;
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, accuracy));
}
```
