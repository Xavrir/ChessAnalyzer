## 📊 Technical Details

### UCI Protocol Implementation

**Supported Commands:**
- `uci` - Initialize engine
- `uciok` - Engine ready signal
- `position fen [fen] moves [moves]` - Set position
- `go depth [depth]` - Start analysis
- `stop` - Stop analysis
- `setoption name MultiPV value [n]` - Set multi-PV lines
- `quit` - Quit engine

**Parsed Info:**
- `depth` - Search depth
- `seldepth` - Selective depth
- `score cp` - Centipawn evaluation
- `score mate` - Mate in N moves
- `nodes` - Nodes searched
- `nps` - Nodes per second
- `time` - Time elapsed (ms)
- `pv` - Principal variation (best line)
- `multipv` - Multi-PV line number

### State Management

**Engine Store State:**
```typescript
{
  isInitialized: boolean;
  isAnalyzing: boolean;
  currentInfo: UCIInfo | null;
  bestMove: string | null;
  ponderMove: string | null;
  multiPVLines: UCIInfo[];
  depth: number (1-30);
  multiPV: number (1-3);
  error: string | null;
  worker: Worker | null;
}
```

**Actions:**
- `initEngine()` - Initialize Stockfish
- `analyzePosition(fen, moves?)` - Analyze position
- `stopAnalysis()` - Stop current analysis
- `setDepth(depth)` - Set analysis depth
- `setMultiPV(multiPV)` - Set multi-PV lines
- `quitEngine()` - Quit and cleanup
- `reset()` - Reset analysis state

### Performance Characteristics

**Expected Performance:**
- Engine initialization: <2s
- Depth 15 analysis: ~2-3s
- Depth 20 analysis: ~5-8s
- Depth 25 analysis: ~15-20s
- UI remains responsive during analysis (Web Worker)

**Memory Usage:**
- Stockfish WASM: ~25-30MB
- Analysis cache: ~5-10MB
- Total overhead: ~35-40MB

- [ ] Create annotation types (blunder, mistake, inaccuracy, brilliant, best, book)
- [ ] Compare player moves vs engine best moves
- [ ] Calculate centipawn loss per move
- [ ] Assign annotations based on thresholds
- [ ] Color-code moves in move list

#### 2. Position Advantage Meter
- [ ] Visual meter showing evaluation over time
- [ ] Line chart with move numbers
- [ ] Highlight critical moments
- [ ] Show evaluation swings
- [ ] Export graph as image

#### 3. Critical Positions
- [ ] Detect positions with evaluation swings >2 pawns
- [ ] Highlight blunders and brilliant moves
- [ ] Show missed wins/draws
- [ ] Bookmarkable positions

#### 4. Accuracy Calculation
- [ ] Calculate player accuracy percentage
- [ ] Compare to engine lines

```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Moves properly annotated (blunder, mistake, etc.)
